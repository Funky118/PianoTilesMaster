\chapter{Analýza zadání}\label{analyza-zadani}
\section{Zadání}
\qquad Vytvořte robota, který bude hrát Piano Tales. Navrhněte stroj, který pomocí Vámi zvoleného HW (snímače a výpočetní jednotky a motorků) bude schopen hrát a porazit člověka ve hře Piano Tales. Referenčním výsledkem bude https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqOW84ZTL7k který se pokusíme porazit. Na závěr vznikne krátké propagační video na youtube obsahujcí logo VUT.
Projekt bude veden pomoci GITu. Dokumentace bude vytvořená v LaTeXu. 
\section{Úvod}\label{uvod}
\qquad Cílem projektu, jak je patrno ze zadání, bylo realizovat robota, který by hrál hru Piano Tales a dosahoval lepších výsledků než člověk a ideálně se přiblížil, nebo dokonce překonal referenční výsledek.

\qquad Hra Piano Tales funguje tak, že po obrazovce ve čtyřech lajnách jezdí obdelníky, jejichž stisknutím se zvýší skóre a rychlost s jakou se pohybují. Hra se tedy neustále ztěžuje. Jakmile nezachytíte již zmiňovaný obdelník nebo kliknete mimo jeho plochu, hra končí. Krom těchto obdelníků, které mají pevně definované rozměry, jezdí po obrazovce i delší obdelníkové úseky, které mají stálou šířku, ale jejich délka se různí \hyperref[pianotales]{(viz. Obr. 1)}. Tyto úseky se liší i barevně. Zatímco obdelníky jsou vždy striktně černé, tak barva úseků se mění od černé na začátku úseku po světlejší odstíny modré na konci. Přidržením těchto úseků od počátku do konce se skóre zvýší více než při pouhém stisknutí.
