<h1>Piano Tiles Master</h1>

A programme for the arduino nano's control over a set of sensor/manipulators. It will play the game Piano Tiles 2 with hopefully higher precision and speed then a human could.

The source code is being written in C++ for practice purposes as well as better readability and easier programming.

Currently the project is mostly done, we're working on solving bugs and making it run as smoothly as possible.
