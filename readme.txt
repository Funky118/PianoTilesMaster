<h1>Piano Tiles Master</h1>

A program for the arduino nano's control over a set of sensor/manipulators. It will play the game with higher precision then a human would.

Right now it's in the process of being written and not all of it's functions work. Should be finished in just a few more lines of code.

I'm using writing it in C++ to practice. My comments definitely need some improvements as does the whole of the code, however being my only critic myself not much can be done about that. Hopefully someone will look over it some day and give me some useful insight.
